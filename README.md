Vestaboard Fires
----------------

This is just a quick and dirty hack to display California wildfire status on
the Vestaboard display I just got.

It has to be running constantly. Every five minutes itt fetches up to four fires
from Cal Fire, gets the details, and then displays their status on the board.
In order to make the board a little more interesting, it displays the last-updated
time in relative format, so that the board changes more often.
